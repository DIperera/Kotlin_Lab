Explanation

-ActivityMainBinding is an auto-generated class created by View Binding in Android.
-Itâ€™s generated from your activity_main.xml layout.
-Instead of using findViewById, you can directly access views like:

val binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
setContentView(binding.root)

binding.btnStartService.setOnClickListener {
    // no need for findViewById
}

ðŸ‘‰ So, ActivityMainBinding is just a safe shortcut to access views from activity_main.xml.
